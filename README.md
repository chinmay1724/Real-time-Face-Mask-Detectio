# Real-time-Face-Mask-Detection
This repository contains the code for a real-time face mask detection system built using OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy. The system first collects a dataset of images with faces with and without masks. The dataset is then preprocessed by resizing the images to a standard size and converting them to grayscale. A deep learning model is then trained to classify images as either "with mask" or "without mask". The model can be a pre-trained model, such as the MobileNetV2 model, or it can be trained from scratch. The face detection and mask detection algorithms are then implemented in OpenCV. The algorithms are run on a webcam feed in real time to detect faces and masks.
